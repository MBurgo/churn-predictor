UNIFICATION_PROMPT = '''
## üìó AI-Driven Data Consolidation & Churn Status Definition Prompt

You are an expert data integration analyst assisting The Motley Fool Australia in proactively identifying at-risk members. Your goal is to unify fragmented customer/member data from three critical business tools (**Stripe**, **Braze**, and **Zendesk**) into a consolidated dataset. Accurate unification is crucial, as it enables targeted interventions that directly support the strategic goal of driving member retention and reducing churn.

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions:

**Step 1: Review Data Sources**  
You have datasets from these tools:

- **Stripe dataset** (Subscription & Payment Data):
  - `customer_id`, `email`, `subscription_status`, `subscription_start_date`, `subscription_end_date`, `subscription_type`, `total_payments`, `payment_failures`, `last_payment_date`.

- **Braze dataset** (Email Engagement Data):
  - `email`, `emails_sent`, `emails_opened`, `emails_clicked`, `percent_emails_opened`, `percent_emails_clicked`, `days_since_last_email_open`, `days_since_last_email_click`.

- **Zendesk dataset** (Customer Support Data):
  - `Requester email`, `Number of tickets`, `Tags`, `Status`, `Priority`, `Created at`, `Updated at`, `Satisfaction Score`, `Replies`, `Reopens`.

**Step 2: Dataset Unification Instructions**  
Merge using the customer's **email** as a unique identifier:

- Rename Zendesk‚Äôs `Requester email` to `email`.
- Keep only the following selected fields:
  - Stripe: `customer_id`, `subscription_status`, `subscription_type`, `total_payments`, `payment_failures`
  - Braze: `percent_emails_clicked`, `days_since_last_email_click`
  - Zendesk: `Number of tickets` ‚Üí rename to `number_of_tickets`, `Tags` ‚Üí rename to `recent_ticket_issue`
- Fill missing numeric fields with `0` and categorical fields with `"unknown"`.

**Step 3: Define Churn Status**  
Clearly define the new column `churn_status` derived from Stripe‚Äôs `subscription_status`:
- `"canceled"` or `"past_due"` ‚Üí `Churned`
- `"active"` ‚Üí `Active`

### üéØ Output Requirements:
- Output one unified CSV dataset with all fields clearly defined.
- Document any assumptions made during unification for full transparency.

# STEP 4: Churn Factor Identification Prompt (Original)
# ----------------------------------------

CHURN_FACTORS_PROMPT = '''
## üìó **AI-driven Churn Factor Identification Prompt**

You are a world-class churn analyst working with The Motley Fool Australia to proactively identify why members cancel their subscriptions. Your insights drive high-impact retention strategies by pinpointing the strongest behavioral and transactional signals of customer churn.

---

### üîç Objective:
Analyze the unified customer dataset and **identify the most predictive churn factors**. Your task is to:
1. Rank predictors by correlation with `churn_status`.
2. Explain the behavioral logic behind each correlation.
3. Recommend actionable thresholds for high- and moderate-correlation features.

---

### ‚úÖ **Dataset Provided:**
Your dataset contains these fields:

- **Churn Status (target)**:
  - `churn_status`: (Churned/Active)

- **Subscription/Payment Fields**:
  - `subscription_type`
  - `total_payments`
  - `payment_failures` (a payment failure refers to a credit card billing attempt rejected due to insufficient funds or member cancellation)

- **Email Engagement Fields**:
  - `percent_emails_clicked`
  - `days_since_last_email_click`

- **Support Interaction Fields**:
  - `number_of_tickets`
  - `recent_ticket_issue`

---

### üìå **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**Step 1: Identify & Rank Churn Factors**  
- Analyze the provided dataset 
- Reason step-by-step through each variable and its likely relationship with churn
- Then identify which customer characteristics and behaviors have the strongest correlation with churn (`churn_status = "Churned"`).  

Then, rank these churn predictors by correlation strength into three clear categories:  
- **High correlation**
- **Moderate correlation**
- **Low correlation**

---

**Step 2: Provide Explanations**  
For each identified churn predictor, clearly explain why the factor logically correlates with churn. Relate each explanation to realistic human behaviors and customer psychology (e.g., dissatisfaction, frustration, disengagement).

---

**Step 3: Suggest Thresholds for Key Factors**  
Suggest clear numeric or categorical thresholds for each high- and moderate-correlation predictor, indicating the point at which churn risk significantly increases. For example:

- `payment_failures ‚â• 2 significantly increases churn risk.`  
- `days_since_last_email_click ‚â• 90 days strongly indicates disengagement.`

---

### üìù **Structured Example Output** (for demonstration):

```
Churn Factor Identification Analysis:

1. High Correlation Predictors:
- Payment Failures (‚â• 2 failures)  
  Explanation: Multiple payment failures (where the member's credit card billing attempts fail) indicate the member is unlikely to renew.

2. Moderate Correlation Predictors:
- Days Since Last Email Click (‚â• 90 days)  
  Explanation: Indicates disengagement or declining interest.

3. Low Correlation Predictors:
- Subscription Type (Epic vs. Basic)  
  Explanation: Subscription type alone has minimal impact; engagement and experience matter more.

---

### ‚úÖ **Output Requirements:**
- Provide a clearly ranked list of churn predictors (High, Moderate, Low).
- Explain why each predictor logically impacts churn.
- Clearly suggest actionable numeric or categorical thresholds.

# STEP 5: Churn Model Rule Definition Prompt
# ----------------------------------------

CHURN_MODEL_PROMPT = """
## üßÆ **AI-driven Churn Prediction Scoring Logic**

You are a senior data scientist at The Motley Fool Australia. Your goal is to create a practical, interpretable scoring model that classifies members into churn risk segments based on their behaviors and interactions. This logic is crucial for driving targeted retention strategies.

---

### üéØ Objective
Design clear, actionable, rule-based churn prediction scoring logic:
- Calculate a numeric `churn_risk_score` (0.0 to 1.0).
- Classify members into segments based on their score:
  - **High Risk**: ‚â• 0.75
  - **Moderate Risk**: 0.4 to 0.74
  - **Low Risk**: < 0.4

---

### üìÇ Dataset Provided (`df` already loaded)

```
customer_id
email
subscription_type
total_payments
payment_failures
percent_emails_clicked
days_since_last_email_click
number_of_tickets
recent_ticket_issue
churn_status ("Churned" or "Active")
```

---

### ‚úÖ Instructions
- Analyze the provided dataset to identify predictive thresholds and assign logical weights.
- Create a scoring function that clearly reflects behavioral insights.
- Assign scores based on realistic thresholds (e.g., payment failures, email engagement).
- Clearly segment users into risk categories based on the calculated score.
- Provide inline comments to clarify reasoning for each rule.

---

### üö® Critical Output Instructions
- Provide **ONLY** executable Python code.
- Do **NOT** include markdown fences (no ```python ... ``` blocks).
- Do **NOT** include explanations or text outside of inline Python comments.
- Your Python code must directly modify the existing DataFrame `df` by adding two new columns:
  - `churn_risk_score`
  - `churn_risk_segment`

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Output Example (Format to Follow Exactly)

```python
def calculate_churn_risk(row):
    risk_score = 0

    # Increment score based on realistic conditions
    if row['payment_failures'] >= 2:
        risk_score += 0.3
    if row['percent_emails_clicked'] < 0.2:
        risk_score += 0.2
    if row['days_since_last_email_click'] >= 90:
        risk_score += 0.25

    # Ensure the score stays within bounds
    risk_score = min(risk_score, 1)

    # Define segments based on risk score
    if risk_score >= 0.75:
        segment = 'High Risk'
    elif risk_score >= 0.4:
        segment = 'Moderate Risk'
    else:
        segment = 'Low Risk'

    return pd.Series([risk_score, segment])

# Apply scoring function to dataframe
df[['churn_risk_score', 'churn_risk_segment']] = df.apply(calculate_churn_risk, axis=1)
