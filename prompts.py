UNIFICATION_PROMPT = '''
## üìó AI-Driven Data Consolidation & Churn Status Definition Prompt

You are an expert data integration analyst assisting The Motley Fool Australia in proactively identifying at-risk members. Your goal is to unify fragmented customer/member data from three critical business tools (**Stripe**, **Braze**, and **Zendesk**) into a consolidated dataset. Accurate unification is crucial, as it enables targeted interventions that directly support the strategic goal of driving member retention and reducing churn.

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions:

**Step 1: Review Data Sources**  
You have datasets from these tools:

- **Stripe dataset** (Subscription & Payment Data):
  - `customer_id`, `email`, `subscription_status`, `subscription_start_date`, `subscription_end_date`, `subscription_type`, `total_payments`, `payment_failures`, `last_payment_date`.

- **Braze dataset** (Email Engagement Data):
  - `email`, `emails_sent`, `emails_opened`, `emails_clicked`, `percent_emails_opened`, `percent_emails_clicked`, `days_since_last_email_open`, `days_since_last_email_click`.

- **Zendesk dataset** (Customer Support Data):
  - `Requester email`, `Number of tickets`, `Tags`, `Status`, `Priority`, `Created at`, `Updated at`, `Satisfaction Score`, `Replies`, `Reopens`.

**Step 2: Dataset Unification Instructions**  
Merge using the customer's **email** as a unique identifier:

- Rename Zendesk‚Äôs `Requester email` to `email`.
- Keep only the following selected fields:
  - Stripe: `customer_id`, `subscription_status`, `subscription_type`, `total_payments`, `payment_failures`
  - Braze: `percent_emails_clicked`, `days_since_last_email_click`
  - Zendesk: `Number of tickets` ‚Üí rename to `number_of_tickets`, `Tags` ‚Üí rename to `recent_ticket_issue`
- Fill missing numeric fields with `0` and categorical fields with `"unknown"`.

**Step 3: Define Churn Status**  
Clearly define the new column `churn_status` derived from Stripe‚Äôs `subscription_status`:
- `"canceled"` or `"past_due"` ‚Üí `Churned`
- `"active"` ‚Üí `Active`

### üéØ Output Requirements:
- Output one unified CSV dataset with all fields clearly defined.
- Document any assumptions made during unification for full transparency.

CHURN_FACTORS_PROMPT = '''
## üìó **AI-driven Churn Factor Identification Prompt**

---

Context: As a churn analyst at The Motley Fool Australia, your insights directly support our strategic goal of reducing member churn and increasing renewal rates. Clearly understanding churn factors enables targeted interventions and proactive retention strategies.

### üéØ **Goal of this Prompt:**
You are an AI-powered churn analyst tasked with analyzing a unified customer dataset containing subscription, engagement, and support data to identify and rank the factors most strongly associated with customer churn.

---

### ‚úÖ **Dataset Provided:**
Your dataset contains these fields:

- **Churn Status (target)**:
  - `churn_status`: (Churned/Active)

- **Subscription/Payment Fields**:
  - `subscription_type`
  - `total_payments`
  - `payment_failures` (a payment failure refers to a credit card billing attempt rejected due to insufficient funds or member cancellation)

- **Email Engagement Fields**:
  - `percent_emails_clicked`
  - `days_since_last_email_click`

- **Support Interaction Fields**:
  - `number_of_tickets`
  - `recent_ticket_issue`

---

### üìå **Instructions:**

**Step 1: Identify & Rank Churn Factors**  
Analyze the provided dataset and identify which customer characteristics and behaviors have the strongest correlation with churn (`churn_status = "Churned"`).  

Rank these churn predictors by correlation strength into three clear categories:  
- **High correlation**
- **Moderate correlation**
- **Low correlation**

---

**Step 2: Provide Explanations**  
For each identified churn predictor, clearly explain why the factor logically correlates with churn. Relate each explanation to realistic human behaviors and customer psychology (e.g., dissatisfaction, frustration, disengagement).

---

**Step 3: Suggest Thresholds for Key Factors**  
Suggest clear numeric or categorical thresholds for each high- and moderate-correlation predictor, indicating the point at which churn risk significantly increases. For example:

- `payment_failures ‚â• 2 significantly increases churn risk.`  
- `days_since_last_email_click ‚â• 90 days strongly indicates disengagement.`

---

### üìù **Structured Example Output** (for demonstration):

```
Churn Factor Identification Analysis:

1. High Correlation Predictors:
- Payment Failures (‚â• 2 failures)  
  Explanation: Multiple payment failures (where the member's credit card billing attempts fail) indicate the member is unlikely to renew.

2. Moderate Correlation Predictors:
- Days Since Last Email Click (‚â• 90 days)  
  Explanation: Indicates disengagement or declining interest.

3. Low Correlation Predictors:
- Subscription Type (Epic vs. Basic)  
  Explanation: Subscription type alone has minimal impact; engagement and experience matter more.
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Output Requirements:**
- Provide a clearly ranked list of churn predictors (High, Moderate, Low).
- Explain why each predictor logically impacts churn.
- Clearly suggest actionable numeric or categorical thresholds.

# STEP 5: Churn Model Rule Definition Prompt
# ----------------------------------------

CHURN_MODEL_PROMPT = """
## üßÆ **AI-driven Churn Prediction Scoring Logic**

As an expert data scientist supporting The Motley Fool Australia‚Äôs strategic retention efforts, your goal is to design clear, practical churn prediction scoring logic. Accurate scoring empowers our team to proactively engage members at the greatest risk of churn, directly improving retention and renewal rates.

---

### ‚úÖ Dataset Fields Provided (already loaded into pandas DataFrame `df`):
- customer_id
- email
- subscription_type
- total_payments
- payment_failures
- percent_emails_clicked
- days_since_last_email_click
- number_of_tickets
- recent_ticket_issue
- churn_status (Active or Churned)

---

### üéØ Your Objective:
Design a practical, easy-to-implement, **rule-based churn prediction scoring logic** based on these fields.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS (Read carefully):**
- **Do NOT attempt to read or load any external CSV or dataset files.**
- Assume the DataFrame named `df` is already loaded into memory.
- Your code must modify `df` directly by adding new columns.
- Do NOT overwrite the existing `df` DataFrame; only add the two new columns.

---

### üìå Instructions:

1. **Analyze the provided sample dataset** carefully to identify realistic thresholds and relationships between features and churn.
2. **Define clear thresholds and assign specific weights** to each predictive feature. For example:
   - `payment_failures` ‚â• 2 ‚Üí add 0.3 to churn_risk_score
   - `percent_emails_clicked` < 20% ‚Üí add 0.2 to churn_risk_score
   - `days_since_last_email_click` ‚â• 90 ‚Üí add 0.25 to churn_risk_score
   - etc.
3. Briefly but clearly justify your scoring logic.
4. Your resulting churn_risk_score must be numeric on a scale from 0 to 1.
5. Classify churn risk based on the final churn_risk_score:
   - **High Risk**: churn_risk_score ‚â• 0.75
   - **Moderate Risk**: churn_risk_score between 0.4 and 0.74
   - **Low Risk**: churn_risk_score < 0.4

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Provide your output as executable Python code that uses pandas to create two new fields: `churn_risk_score` and `churn_risk_segment`.

Follow this structured example exactly:

```python
# Example (Replace with your analysis-based logic)
import pandas as pd

def calculate_churn_risk(row):
    risk_score = 0

    if row['payment_failures'] >= 2:
        risk_score += 0.3
    if row['percent_emails_clicked'] < 20:
        risk_score += 0.2
    if row['days_since_last_email_click'] >= 90:
        risk_score += 0.25
    if row['number_of_tickets'] >= 3:
        risk_score += 0.15
    if row['total_payments'] <= 1:
        risk_score += 0.1

    risk_score = min(risk_score, 1)

    if risk_score >= 0.75:
        risk_segment = 'High Risk'
    elif risk_score >= 0.4:
        risk_segment = 'Moderate Risk'
    else:
        risk_segment = 'Low Risk'

    return pd.Series([risk_score, risk_segment])

df[['churn_risk_score', 'churn_risk_segment']] = df.apply(calculate_churn_risk, axis=1)

### ‚úÖ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide your scoring logic explicitly within markdown python fences (python ... ).
- Do **NOT** attempt to read external files (pd.read_csv or similar operations are explicitly prohibited).
- Ensure your logic is realistic, actionable, and clearly explained. 
- Ensure your code directly modifies the provided DataFrame df.
